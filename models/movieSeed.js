    review: "Interstellar is true sci-fi yet remains accessible. It honors technical details but is driven by relatable emotions. Despite contemplating mankind's extinction, Interstellar is a father-daughter story at its core. Therefore, the film is both epic and intimate. There are themes of survival, love, and sacrifice (which sounds cliche but is actually quite philosophical). There are motivated characters, twists, setup/payoff, closed-loop time travel, and thorough world-building. Yes, dialogue occasionally overexplains and plot holes exist, but Interstellar's adventure, science, philosophy, and heart wash that away. Overall, this is an ambitious story that nails every key ingredient.",
